# PDB-matching


Before we calculate RMSD, it is often a good pratice to make sure the ref.pdb
and model.pdb files have the same chain IDs and the same residue numbering.

## Two main scripts
- Step 1. `pdb_match_chn_batch.py`: match chain IDs of pdb files to ref.pdb
- Step 2. `pdb_renum_batch.py`: align and renumber pdb files to ref.pdb

## Step 1: Match chain IDs to ref.pdb

### For a list of pdb files
- `pdb_match_chn.py`:

    -> match chain IDs for two PDB files (Does not always work well. Need to
    manually check the results!)
    
- `pdb_rename_chain.py`:

    -> rename chain IDs of a pdb file according to the ref.pdb (the chain ID map file generated by `pdb_match_chn.py`)

### For a list of pdb files
- `pdb_match_chn_batch.py`


## Step 2: Renumber pdb files to ref.pdb

### For two PDB files
- `pdb-pdbalign ref.pdb chainID model.pdb chainID`:  

    -> align and renumber model.pdb according to ref.pdb. Output: new model.pdb
    
    -> If model.pdb has a residue that is not in ref.pdb, new_model.pdb will use X to denote this residue: e.g., `ATOM   1447  N   GLN X   1 ...`.
- `pdb_renumber_onepair_EXMPL.sh`:  

    -> an example code

### For a list of pdb files
- `pdb_renum_batch.py file.list 'A,C,D,E'`, where 'A,C,D,E' are matched chain IDs
